# Trialshopy-Backend - Getting Started Guide

Welcome to the Trialshopy Backend project! This guide will walk you through the process of creating a fork, cloning the repository, and setting up the project for development. This backend is developed using TypeScript and Node.js.

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. **Git**: You'll need Git to clone the repository and manage version control.
2. **Node.js and npm**: The project is built using Node.js, so you'll need them installed to run the code.
3. **TypeScript**: The project uses TypeScript for development.

## Fork the Repository

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the repository page. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

## Clone the Fork

1. **Clone the Forked Repository**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Then run the following command to clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/trialshopy-backend.git

**NOTE**: Replace the URL with your forks' git URL 

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Move into the project directory using the following command:
    ```bash 
    cd trialshopy-backend

## Setup the Project
1. Install Dependencies: In the project directory, run the following command to install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install

## Start Development


1. **Start the Server**: Run the following command to start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
  
2. If above command doesn't work you can try to compile and run server using below commands:
    ```bash
    tsc
    node dist/server.js

The server will start and be accessible at: http://localhost:7000, and you'll see console logs indicating that the server is running.

3. **Work on the Code**: You can now start working on the project! The source code is located in the src directory. Make changes, add features, fix bugs, etc.

## Contributing and Pull Requests
1. **Create a New Branch**: Before making changes, create a new branch to work on. This helps keep your changes isolated from the main codebase:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/new-feature
2. **Commit Your Changes**: As you make changes, commit them with meaningful messages:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add new feature: XYZ"

3. **Push Changes and Create Pull Request**: Push your changes to **your forked repository** and then create a pull request from your fork to the original repository.

## Keeping Your Fork Updated
1. The original repository might receive updates. To keep your fork up-to-date, you can set the original repository as an upstream remote and fetch changes.

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-author/trialshopy-backend.git
    git fetch upstream
    git checkout main
    git merge upstream/main

**NOTE**: Replace the URL in above with the original repository URL
